## 🎶 About The Project

**DreamTone** is an intelligent music generator that transforms your creative ideas into original melodies and compositions. Whether you're a musician suffering from writer's block, a content creator in need of a unique soundtrack, or just curious about the power of AI in music, DreamTone provides the tools to bring your auditory concepts to life.

This application leverages artificial intelligence to generate music based on three flexible input methods: a simple song description, your own lyrics, or lyrics generated by AI.

## 🏛️ Architecture

This project is a **full-stack application built entirely with Next.js**.

- The **Frontend UI** is a modern React application built with Next.js App Router.
- The **Backend Logic** is handled by **Next.js API Routes**, which are deployed as serverless functions. This provides a scalable, efficient, and integrated backend without the need for a separate, constantly running server.

Some of the more intensive AI processing or other backend tasks may be handled by standalone serverless functions, which are called from the Next.js API routes.

## 🔎 Features

- **Music from Description**: Describe the mood, genre, tempo, or instruments (e.g., "A melancholic, slow-paced piano melody"), and the AI will compose it.
- **Lyrics-to-Song**: Provide your own lyrics, and DreamTone will generate a musical composition that matches the emotion and structure of your words.
- **AI-Generated Lyrics**: Don't have lyrics? The app can generate creative, context-aware lyrics and then set them to music.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Fine-tune the generated music by specifying different styles and instruments.
- **Serverless & Scalable**: Built to handle dynamic traffic loads efficiently.
- **Reliable Background Processing**: Music generation is handled as a background job via Inngest, so you can close the app and the job will still complete.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Core Framework**: Next.js (for both UI and API)
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js, API Routes (Serverless Functions), Inngest
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face, a Python serverless functions (using Modal)
- **Storage**: AWS S3
